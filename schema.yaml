    releaseNote: >-
      Underlying Weaviate version is 0.22.7, a different published version is due
      to GCP Marketplace restrictions of not being able to update the deploy
      scripts without increasing the version number.
      See https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate/releases/tag/0.22.7 for full release notes.
